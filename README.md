Assignment: Create anything we want in any oop language

My creation: Entertainment Tonight  (Individual project made just by me)

Decription of project: 

I made a website called Entertainment Tonight. This website is designed for people travelling
to new cities and want to see what events on. The person can search by city and the category they
want ie. music,comedy, and if an event exists, they can see it! Users can also add their own 
events. This was intended for people in a city who are lets say in a bar and there is  great
local band playing, they can make an event and tell people about it. Simple. This website gives
the user control to post events, which people would not have known about before. The user
can register,login/logout on the website. This website gives local events promotations as
users could be anywhere and post about an event! If you've just arrived in a new city and you 
want to do something tonight  or you are at a great event and want to tell people about it,
Entertainment Tonight is just what you need! 


Language and Platform I used: The oop language is used is PYTHON. I used a python web framwork called Django to build a web appplication called Entertainment Tonight.



CONCEPT

What was the idea for my website?

 	 The idea of my website is for people going to new cities, are able to see the local events
 	 posted by users that are on. Example, if someone goes to Paris, the user can see what 
 	 others have posted about different events that are in. It's targeted for tourists, 
 	 students and anybody who wants to find out whats on in a given city.

		
DESIGN

Why did i choose to do my final OOP assignment in python? 

 	 I fell in love with the idea of classes and objects. Using them in programs make life so much easier.
 	 We had to use an object orientated language for our assignment.I was using Java in 2 modules 
 	 programming and algorithms.I wanted to take this time to learn a new OOP language. I said to myself 
 	 I know C, and im doing java, so why not take this opportunity to learn a new language.This new 
 	 language is python! Not the snake, the programming language! I am a great self learner and really enjoyed using this language on the django frame work to create:

	*** Entertainment Tonight ***

TECHNICAL DESIGN OF MY WEBSITE

- I made this website using a python framework called Django. Within Django I incorporated
  html,bootstrap and css to make and style my website! 

- When making each page, I had to make url's to the tell the program which functions to run 
  in the view class to display the relevent page.

- I had never properly worked with the ins/out's of Urls and when I got my head around 
  how they work, my website fell into place.

- My code is organised into classes. I created instances of the classes using objects. I used the
  Database to store relevent information (incl; event info, user info)

- The use of objects allowed me create multiple events and users. Objects are prevailent 
   through out the whole of my website.

- As mentioned before I used python. 
- Some things i used python for : 

 - To create classes which INHERIT from the model class. Each model in python class the subclassess
   django.db.models.Model. The model class is source of information about the data contaioned in my website. I had 3 models, Event,Cities and Type. Django has a built
   in User model. Each model contaions the fields an behaviours about my data. It then maps to the databse to allow me to add data to the fiels.

 - I used python in forms, to irerate through the fields of my model. I did this using loops.

 - I used python to authenticate users and do general error checking.

 - I used it to navigate through pages and redirect the user to different pages

 And much more!
