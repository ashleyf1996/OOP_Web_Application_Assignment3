CONCEPT

What was the idea for my website?

 	 The idea of my website is for people going to new cities, are able to see the local events
 	 posted by users that are on. Example, if someone goes to Paris, the user can see what 
 	 others have posted about different events that are in. It's targeted for tourists, 
 	 students and anybody who wants to find out whats on in a given city.

		
DESIGN

Why did i choose to do my final OOP assignment in python? 

 	 I fell in love with the idea of classes and objects. Using them in programs make life so much easier.
 	 We had to use an object orientated language for our assignment.I was using Java in 2 modules 
 	 programming and algorithms.I wanted to take this time to learn a new OOP language. I said to myself 
 	 I know C, and im doing java, so why not take this opportunity to learn a new language.This new 
 	 language is python! Not the snake, the programming language! I am a great self learner and really enjoyed using this language on the django frame work to create:

TECHNICAL DESIGN OF MY WEBSITE

- I made this website using a python framework called Django. Within Django I incorporated
  html,bootstrap and css to make and style my website! 

- When making each page, I had to make url's to the tell the program which functions to run 
  in the view class to display the relevent page.

- I had never properly worked with the ins/out's of Urls and when I got my head around 
  how they work, my website fell into place.

- My code is organised into classes. I created instances of the classes using objects. I used the
  Database to store relevent information (incl; event info, user info)
