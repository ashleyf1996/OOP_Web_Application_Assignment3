CONCEPT

What was the idea for my website?

 	IThe idea of my website is for people going to new cities, are able to see the local events posted by users that are on. Example, if someone goes to Paris, the user can see what others have posted about different events that are in. It's targeted for tourists, students and anybody who wants to find out whats on in a given city.

		
DESIGN

Why did i choose to do my final OOP assignment in python? 

 	I fell in love with the idea of classes and objects. Using them in programs make life so much easier. We had to use an object orientated language for our assignment. I was using Java in 2 modules programming and algorithms. I wanted to take this time to learn a new OOP language. I said to myself I know C, and im doing java, so why not take this opportunity to learn a new language. This new language is python! Not the snake, the programming language! I am a great self learner and really enjoyed using this language on the django frame work to create:
