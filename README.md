**Assignment:** Create anything we want in any oop language

**My creation:** Entertainment Tonight  (Individual project made just by me)

**Decription of project:**

I made a website called Entertainment Tonight. This website is designed for people travelling
to new cities and want to see what events are on. The person can search by city and 
the category they want ie. music,comedy, and if an event exists, they can see it! Users can also add their own events. This was intended for people in a city who are lets say in a bar and there is  great local band playing, they can make an event and tell people about it. Simple. This website gives the user control to post events, which people would not have known about before. The user
can register,login/logout on the website. This website gives local events promotations as
users could be anywhere and post about an event! If you've just arrived in a new city and you 
want to do something tonight or you are at a great event and want to tell people about it,
Entertainment Tonight is just what you need! 


Language and Platform I used: The oop language is used is PYTHON. I used a python web framwork called Django to build a web appplication called Entertainment Tonight.


		
**DESIGN**

Why did i choose to do my final OOP assignment in python? 

 	 I fell in love with the idea of classes and objects. Using them in programs make life so much easier.
 	 We had to use an object orientated language for our assignment.I was using Java in 2 modules 
 	 programming and algorithms.I wanted to take this time to learn a new OOP language. I said to myself 
 	 I know C, and im doing java, so why not take this opportunity to learn a new language.This new 
 	 language is python! Not the snake, the programming language! I am a great self learner and really enjoyed using this language on the django frame work to create:

	*** Entertainment Tonight ***


**FEATURES**

What is in my website?

	Home Page:

	- Fistly, when you go on to my website, you see the home page.
	- From the home page you can navigate to anyother page on the website.
	-A user can register, login/logout. 
	- On the home page, there is text, images and fun fact button for the user to press.

	About us page:

 	- This page informs the user what the website is all about!

 	Event page:

 	- This is the page where the user can search for a city and a matching category.
 	- Once the user has enetered their preferences, They can view the relevant events related.

 	Add event page:

 	- This is where a user can add an event.
	
	Login/Logout/Register page

	- This is where a user can login, logout and register for the website. 

**TECHNICAL DESIGN OF MY WEBSITE**

- I made this website using a python framework called Django. Within Django I incorporated
  html,bootstrap and css to make and style my website! 

- When making each page, I had to make url's to the tell the program which functions to run 
  in the view class to display the relevent page.

- I had never properly worked with the ins/out's of Urls and when I got my head around 
  how they work, my website fell into place.

- My code is organised into classes. I created instances of the classes using objects. I used the
  Database to store relevent information (incl; event info, user info)

- The use of objects allowed me create multiple events and users. Objects are prevailent 
   through out the whole of my website.

- As mentioned before I used python. 
- Some things i used python for : 

 - To create classes which INHERIT from the model class. Each model in python class the subclassess
   django.db.models.Model. The model class is source of information about the data contaioned in my website. I had 3 models, Event,Cities and Type. Django has a built
   in User model. Each model contaions the fields an behaviours about my data. It then maps to the databse to allow me to add data to the fiels.

 - I used python in forms, to irerate through the fields of my model. I did this using loops.

 - I used python to authenticate users and do general error checking.

 - I used it to navigate through pages and redirect the user to different pages

 And much more!


 **FEATURES IM PROUD OF**

 1. I thought myself a NEW LANGUAGE! This was challenging at first, I had to step in to the world
    of python and learn lots of new syntax. I am proud I managed to teach myself a new language and
    complete and built a website using that new language I learned

 2. I never heard of DJANGO (the platform i used) before this assignment. I had to teach myself
    how to use it and wrap my head around the workings of how to use it. As mentioned above I had
    to wrap my head around urls. Also I have only ever made a website using basic html never with
    an oop language, So I learn to encorporate them both to create this website.

 3. The TECHNICAL THINGS I am proud of, the things we learn on the course with bryan included 
    CLASSES,OBJECTS,POLYMORPHISM,INHERITANCE AND INTERFACES. All of these elements are in my website
    and made my website possible. Everything is organised into classes, objects are used to make instances of the classes, my model classes are a subclass of the django superclass MODEL, my view classes are a subclass of the django super class View theses are examples of POLYMOREPHISM AND INHERTANCE. 

 4. I am proud of the APPREANCE of my website. I decided on the colour of purple to be the scheme of
    my website. 

 5. INHERITANCE is something that has really helped me in this assignment. I mentioned above the 
    first thing i used inheritance for. The other thing i used inheritance for is the design of my 
    website. I knew each page had to have a header menu, title footer and body. So made a base html page and included the common elements to my page. In each page i included extend base html this meant i didnt have THE SAME CODE for the common elements in everypage i just had it once in base html. 

 6. There are many things I am proud of in this assignment. I did this ON MY OWN, I THOUGHT MYSELF 
    a new language, I used classes and objects. 


 **CONCLUSION**

 I really enjoyed making this website. This was my favourite OOP assignment. For many reasons, I have a much better understanding of how classes and objects work. I leart python. I learned how to use bootstrap. The skills I have learnt in this assignment will definitely stand to me in the future!


 **ENJOY ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT!**
